## 🙌 Introduction 🙌
Hello, I'm Minjeong Joo!

I am an enthusiastic beginner front-end engineer with a keen interest in web development.💻</br>
Currently, I am on a journey to learn and master the skills necessary to build beautiful and functional websites. </br>
I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.</br>

In addition to my passion for web development, I love playing golf.⛳️</br>
It helps me relax and stay focused. </br>
Golf also teaches me patience and the importance of continuous improvement, both of which are valuable in my coding journey.</br>
